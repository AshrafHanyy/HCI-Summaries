				==A key aspect of the design of technologies is to provide people with a clear model, so that they will develop a clear mental model but of course that depends on what they know already, their background, experiences, etc.==
	1.  <font style="color:red"> Usage Differences</font>: Experts versus novices, discretionary (experts) users of tech, difference in designing for heterogeneous group or homogeneous group 
	

# Activities: 
1. **Temporal Aspects:** to do with timing, frequency, etc.
2. **Co-operation and Complexity:** working with others or not
3. **Safety Critical:** What problems would happen if something went wrong?
	1. Examples: are you sure you want to delete this item? 
4. **Content:** What information and media re we dealing with?
5. Data and Media Requirements
